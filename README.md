## Introduction

This notebook is a companion to [Finstad et al., Astrophys. J. Lett. 860 (2018) L2]https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/aac6c1) which is also posted at [arxiv:1804.04179](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04179). It demonstrates how to read and use our posterior proability density files from the MCMC and shows how to reconstruct Figure 1 in the paper from the raw data.

We encourage use of these data in derivative works. If you use the material provided here, please cite the paper using the reference:

The data provided contain the thinned posterior samples from the MCMC chains used to produce the posterior proability density plots shown in Figure 1. These data are stored in the files:

 1. [gw_only_posteriors.hdf](https://github.com/sugwg/gw170817-inclination-angle/blob/master/gw_only_posteriors.hdf)  contains the posterior samples from the MCMC where we only use the gravitational-wave data.
 2. [gw_and_skyloc_posteriors.hdf](https://github.com/sugwg/gw170817-inclination-angle/blob/master/gw_and_skyloc_posteriors.hdf) containes the posterior samples from the MCMC where we use the gravitational-wave data and fix the sky location of GW170817 to RA = 197.450374, Dec = -23.381495 from [Soares-Santos et al. (2017).](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9059/meta)

 3. [gw_skyloc_and_dist_posteriors.hdf](https://github.com/sugwg/gw170817-inclination-angle/blob/master/gw_skyloc_and_dist_posteriors.hdf) contains the posterior samples from the MCMC where we use the gravitational-wave data, fix the sky location of GW170817 to RA = 197.450374, Dec = -23.381495 from [Soares-Santos et al., (2017)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aa9059/meta), and use a Gaussian prior on the luminosity distance taken from [Cantiello et al. (2018).](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/aaad64/meta)

The results used in the paper were generated with the [PyCBC v1.9.4 release.](https://github.com/gwastro/pycbc/releases/tag/v1.9.4)

## Runing this notebook in a Docker container

This notebook can be run from a PyCBC Docker container, or a machine with PyCBC installed. Instructions for [downloading the docker container](http://gwastro.github.io/pycbc/latest/html/docker.html) are available from the [PyCBC home page.](https://pycbc.org/) To start a container with instance of Jupyter notebook, run the commands
```sh
docker pull pycbc/pycbc-el7:v1.9.4
docker run -p 8888:8888 --name pycbc_notebook -it pycbc/pycbc-el7:v1.9.4 /bin/bash -l
```
Once the container has started, this git repository can be downloaded with the command:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sugwg/gw170817-inclination-angle.git
```
The notebook server can be started inside the container with the command:
```sh
jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser
```
You can then connect to the notebook server at the URL printed by ``jupyter``. Navigate to the directory `gw170817-inclination-angle` in the cloned git repository and open [data_release_companion.ipynb](https://github.com/sugwg/gw170817-inclination-angle/blob/master/data_release_companion.ipynb), the notebook that demonstartes use of these reults.
